# Underwater-Object-Tracking

This project involves simulating underwater object tracking using SONAR technology and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). It focuses on experiments with non-linear transformations for accurate state estimation and object tracking. The project includes realistic simulation environments, SONAR pulse generation, and advanced filtering techniques, demonstrating applications in marine biology, underwater navigation, and defense.
